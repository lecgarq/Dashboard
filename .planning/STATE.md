# Project State

## Project Reference

See: `.planning/PROJECT.md` (updated 2026-06-23)

**Core value:** Truthful, fast analytics over the fully extracted ACC dataset.
**Current focus:** Baseline reset — all ACC data extracted and verified.

## Status

- **Milestone:** data-extraction-confirmed baseline
- **State:** Data extraction COMPLETE and VERIFIED. Ready for next milestone
  (`/gsd:new-milestone`).

## Data Extraction — Verified 2026-06-23

Confirmed read-only against the live local PostgreSQL DB.

### Census (`scripts/count-acc-data.cjs` logic, no-SSL)

| Table / metric | Count |
|----------------|-------|
| AccProject (live API) | 1,153 |
| AccDcProject (Data Connector) | 550 |
| AccFolder | 415,908 |
| AccFolder — sized (contents crawled) | 111,308 |
| AccFolder — total files | 420,096 |
| AccFolder — total size | 3.17 TB |
| AccFolderPermission | 6,040,610 |
| AccProjectMember (live) | 14,566 |
| AccDcProjectUser | 22,835 |
| AccActivity (Data Connector events) | 1,102,030 |
| AccActivityAccds (web-session crawl) | 4,554,785 |
| Distinct projects in AccActivityAccds | 956 |
| Folder-crawl status | 975 ok / 178 inaccessible (= 1,153) |
| Activity by source | project 1,101,159 / admin 871 |
| AccDcIngestRun | 72 |

### Merge integrity (`scripts/verify-accds-merge.cjs`, partitioned mode)

All 5 assertions PASS:

- `accds=4,554,785  dc_backfill=41,714  dc_admin=871`
- Unified total `4,597,370` == merged query `4,597,370` (reconciliation)
- backfill kept (41,714), account-level admin kept (871)
- boundary spot-check (latest-start project) reconciles

### Notes

- Folder total size is **3.17 TB** now vs ~3.4 TB recorded at crawl time — minor
  drift, not a correctness failure.
- All other figures match the recorded Phase 8 gates to the row (4.55M activity
  rows, 956 projects, 111,308 sized folders).

## Next Action

Define the next milestone with `/gsd:new-milestone` (Active requirements are
intentionally empty in this baseline).
