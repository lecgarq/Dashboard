# Project State

## Project Reference

See: `.planning/PROJECT.md` (updated 2026-07-01)

**Core value:** Truthful, fast analytics over the fully extracted ACC dataset.
**Current focus:** v2.3 New Graphs (opened 2026-07-02) — new charts for `/access-analysis` (+ `/template-mty` where a genuine fit exists) from existing-but-unvisualized Prisma data. Roadmap created; ready to plan Phase 20.

## Current Position

- **Milestone:** v2.3 — New Graphs (opened 2026-07-02). Scope: 8 requirements (ISSUE-01–05, PERM-01, ENG-01, PIPE-01) across 4 phases (20-23), continuing sequential phase numbering from v2.2's Phase 19. No new data sources, no new npm dependencies, no new WebGL, honest coverage labels.
- **Phase:** 20 — Foundation Wins & Engagement Panels (not yet planned)
- **Plan:** — (none yet; next step is `/gsd:plan-phase 20`)
- **Status:** Ready to plan phase 20
- **Last activity:** 2026-07-02 — Roadmap created (`.planning/ROADMAP.md` v2.3 section added: Phase 20 Foundation Wins & Engagement Panels → ISSUE-01/PERM-01/ENG-01/PIPE-01; Phase 21 Issue Funnel → ISSUE-02/ISSUE-03; Phase 22 Issue Type Resolution → ISSUE-04/ISSUE-05; Phase 23 Workshop Curation & Milestone Close → no new requirements, milestone-closing gate). `.planning/REQUIREMENTS.md` traceability table filled (8/8 mapped, all "Pending").

## Status (data baseline — still current)

- **State:** Data extraction COMPLETE and VERIFIED (census below), unchanged since 2026-06-23. v2.1/v2.2 shipped on this baseline; v2.3 adds charts over it without changing the data.

## Data Extraction — Verified 2026-06-23

Confirmed read-only against the live local PostgreSQL DB.

### Census (`scripts/count-acc-data.cjs` logic, no-SSL)

| Table / metric | Count |
|----------------|-------|
| AccProject (live API) | 1,153 |
| AccDcProject (Data Connector) | 550 |
| AccFolder | 415,908 |
| AccFolder — sized (contents crawled) | 111,308 |
| AccFolder — total files | 420,096 |
| AccFolder — total size | 3.17 TB |
| AccFolderPermission | 6,040,610 |
| AccProjectMember (live) | 14,566 |
| AccDcProjectUser | 22,835 |
| AccActivity (Data Connector events) | 1,102,030 |
| AccActivityAccds (web-session crawl) | 4,554,785 |
| Distinct projects in AccActivityAccds | 956 |
| Folder-crawl status | 975 ok / 178 inaccessible (= 1,153) |
| Activity by source | project 1,101,159 / admin 871 |
| AccDcIngestRun | 72 |

### Merge integrity (`scripts/verify-accds-merge.cjs`, partitioned mode)

All 5 assertions PASS: `accds=4,554,785 dc_backfill=41,714 dc_admin=871`; unified total `4,597,370` == merged query `4,597,370`; backfill + account-admin rows kept; boundary spot-check reconciles.

> Note: `AccFolderPermission` = ~6.04M rows here (census) — the "~5M-row scan" language in code/CONCERNS predates the last folder crawl; REF-03 (shipped in v2.2) targeted whichever count was live at build time.

### v2.3-specific verified counts (research pass, 2026-07-02)

| Table / metric | Count | Source |
|-----------------|-------|--------|
| `AccFolderPermissionSummary` (materialized in v2.2 Ph18/19) | 22,082 rows | `.planning/research/ARCHITECTURE.md` |
| `AccIssue` issue-type GUIDs | 316 distinct `issueTypeId` | REQUIREMENTS.md ISSUE-04 (verified live 2026-07-02) |
| `AccIssue` issue-subtype GUIDs | 515 distinct `issueSubtypeId` | REQUIREMENTS.md ISSUE-04 (verified live 2026-07-02) |
| `AccIssue` full set (funnel scope) | 17,360 issues | REQUIREMENTS.md ISSUE-02 |
| `AccIssue.status` distinct live values | 8 (open, closed, completed, in_review, draft, pending, not_approved, in_progress) | REQUIREMENTS.md ISSUE-03 |
| `AccProjectMember`, `AccDcIngestRun`, `AccIssueFetchRun`/`AccIssueProjectFetchResult` exact row counts | `VERIFY:` not independently re-counted this pass | `.planning/research/ARCHITECTURE.md` (reasoned estimates: tens of thousands / 72 / small-per-run — all well below `AccActivityAccds` scale) |

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

v2.1/v2.2 (shipped) decisions are recorded in `PROJECT.md` Key Decisions + the per-plan
SUMMARY files in `.planning/phases/09..19`. Decisions relevant to v2.3 planning:

- **v2.3 roadmap = 4 phases (20-23), not the 5-wave shape from research SUMMARY.md.**
  Research suggested 5 phases matching risk-graded waves across the original 9 candidates;
  after REQUIREMENTS.md scoped the milestone to 8 requirements (4 seeds deferred to Future
  Requirements), the roadmap folds ENG-01 (dormant users) into the foundation-wins phase
  (Phase 20) alongside ISSUE-01/PERM-01/PIPE-01 — all four are P1/LOW-risk panels that share
  no file surface except `mainCharts.tsx`/`AccessAnalysisCharts.tsx` (per ARCHITECTURE.md),
  so grouping them avoids repeated merge contention on those two files across four separate
  phases and avoids a thin single-requirement "ENG-01 only" phase (granularity guidance).
  Standalone phases are preserved for: the issue funnel (ISSUE-02/03 — new groupBy shapes),
  issue type resolution (ISSUE-04/05 — the only phase carrying external APS-call +
  Prisma-migration risk, isolated per PITFALLS.md/ARCHITECTURE.md), and a final workshop
  curation + milestone-close gate (Phase 23, zero new requirements — mandatory per
  PITFALLS.md Pitfall 7, not automatic).

- **Phase numbering continues sequentially from v2.2** (Phase 20, not reset to Phase 1) —
  consistent with how v2.1→v2.2 continued 09→19 without a milestone-scoped reset; `config.json`
  has no `phase_id_convention` key, so the default `sequential` form (`### Phase N:`) applies.

- **ISSUE-04 must land before ISSUE-05 within Phase 22** — the lookup-table backfill (external
  APS call + new Prisma model/migration) is the milestone's only genuinely risky item; it is
  planned/executed/verified as an earlier plan than the issues-by-type chart that consumes it.

- **Deferred from v2.3 scope (see REQUIREMENTS.md "Future Requirements"):** folder storage
  treemap (needs depth-cap/leaf-rollup UX design), permission tier × folder-depth heatmap
  (needs its own OOM/perf regression test against the test-pinned `folderPermQuery.ts`),
  activity verb/object-type breakdown (needs top-N/other bucketing design + must avoid the
  deferred spatial-graph-coupled `lib→app` edges), provisioned-vs-active module coverage
  (needs `products` Json → `ModuleId[]` vocabulary alignment). None of these are in Phase 20-23.

- **Guardrails carried into every v2.3 phase** (from PITFALLS.md, HIGH confidence, repo-grounded):
  never chart `AccDcIngestRun.rowsByModule` (confirmed always-zero); convert
  `AccFolderPermissionSummary.totalBytes` (BigInt) server-side before the RSC→client boundary;
  never duplicate the `AccFolderPermission` join — future heatmap-style work must import
  `loadFolderPermRows` from `lib/server/folderPermQuery.ts`, never re-derive it; never
  hardcode the historical "428/1,152" DC-coverage figure — always call a live loader; every
  new `AccActivityAccds`/`AccActivity`/`AccFolder`-scale aggregate must be server-side SQL/
  `groupBy`, never `findMany` + JS reduce (the TEST-01 OOM-guard class of regression);
  `mainCharts.tsx`'s `Promise.all` fan-out (8 entries pre-v2.3) should be reviewed for
  consolidation once 3+ new loaders share a data domain, not left to grow unbounded.

Prior (v2.1/v2.2) decisions still relevant as standing constraints:

- **QUERY-01/REF-02 shipped (2026-07-01, commit a4d923ca).** `lib/server/folderPermQuery.ts` owns the shared base `AccFolderPermission` join. Both terrain loaders (`templateFolderTerrain.ts` all-folders; `folderPermissionTerrainView.ts` l2Only) consume it via `loadFolderPermRows(projectId, { l2Only? })`. Any new consumer (e.g. a future heatmap) must import, not fork, this function.

- **REF-01 access-analysis splits shipped (2026-07-01, Phase 16).** `folderTerrain.ts` → `folderTerrainModel`/`folderTerrainLayout`/`folderTerrainScene`/`folderTerrainCamera` + thin barrel (SPLIT-01). `FolderPermissionTerrain.tsx` → `useFolderPermissionTerrainCamera` (hook) + `terrainViewModel` (pure) + `TerrainStage`/`TerrainControls` (presentational) + thin shell (SPLIT-02). All 9 files ≤ ~400 lines; pinning tests byte-identical; owner visual parity confirmed.

- **PROJ-02/PROJ-03 shipped (2026-07-02, Phase 19).** `AccFolderPermissionSummary` (22,082 rows, materialized in Ph18) is the summary-aggregate consumer's data source; the `includePermissionContexts:true` raw scan is hard-guarded behind `ACC_ALLOW_RAW_PERMISSION_SCAN=1` (throws by default); a refresh mechanism runs inside `dc-daily-ingest.cjs`'s success branch (≤1-ingest-cycle staleness, documented in INTEGRATIONS.md). This is the exact table Phase 20's permission-footprint-by-role panel reads — zero touch of the raw ~6M-row table required.

- **Behavior-preserving refactors only (v2.1/v2.2 guardrail, still binding for shared modules).** REF-01/REF-02/REF-03 characterization tests (TEST-02 `folderPermissionTerrainView.test.ts`, TEST-03 `templateFolderTerrain.sharedQuery.test.ts`, TEST-01 OOM guard) must stay byte-identical / green through v2.3 as well — any v2.3 phase touching `folderPermQuery.ts` or `acc-hot-cache.ts` inherits this guardrail.

- **Gates:** `npx tsc --noEmit` before any rebuild; deploy = rebuild + Task Scheduler
  restart on `:3000` (not a branch merge); Prisma migrations on this DB have historically
  choked on pgvector — apply via raw `ALTER` + `prisma migrate resolve` when `migrate dev`
  fails (directly relevant to Phase 22's new issue-type lookup table migration).

- **`.planning/` mid-migration:** `MILESTONES.md`/`RETROSPECTIVE.md`/`milestones/` are
  deleted in the working tree; v1.0/v2.0/v2.1/v2.2 history lives only in git HEAD. v2.3
  continues evolving PROJECT/STATE/REQUIREMENTS/ROADMAP in place (same "safe logical close"
  pattern used for v2.1 and v2.2).

- **gsd-tools `phase complete` is unreliable on this repo** — it has previously mangled
  STATE frontmatter on phase close (wrong milestone label, wrong progress numbers). **Always
  inspect and repair STATE frontmatter (milestone/status/current_phase/progress) manually
  after running it**, including during v2.3 phase closes.

### Blockers/Concerns

- None blocking v2.3 Phase 20. Risk is concentrated and isolated in Phase 22 (ISSUE-04's
  external APS call + new Prisma migration) — tracked above and sequenced deliberately after
  the lower-risk Phase 20/21 work.

- **Open (non-blocking, carried from v2.2):** owner visual sign-off on the Phase 17
  HybridAnalyticsSurface split (SPLIT-04) has not occurred — `/users/access-analysis`
  currently redirects to `/users/spatial-graph` and no production code mounts the surface.
  Parity was accepted on the byte-identical DOM-golden-test basis instead. Revisit if/when
  the surface gets a live, unflagged mount. Not part of v2.3 scope.

- Branch is `feat/access-analysis-redesign` with heavy uncommitted WIP + the `.planning/`
  migration deletions in the working tree. **Commit by explicit path only** (never `-A`/`.`);
  check `git diff --cached --name-only` before every commit. `.planning/config.json` is
  pre-existing WIP (research→false, tsc-only build_command) — leave it out of doc commits.

## Next Action

Roadmap created for milestone **v2.3 New Graphs** (`.planning/ROADMAP.md` updated in place;
`.planning/REQUIREMENTS.md` traceability filled 8/8). Next: `/gsd:plan-phase 20` (Foundation
Wins & Engagement Panels: ISSUE-01, PERM-01, ENG-01, PIPE-01).

Prior milestone **v2.2 Structural Refactors** shipped + closed 2026-07-02 via safe-logical-close
(tagged `v2.2` local; 5/5 phases 15–19, 9/9 plans, 8/8 requirements; owner parity approved after
a fresh `:3000` rebuild). Full record: PROJECT.md Shipped Milestone section, `.planning/phases/15..19`
SUMMARY/VERIFICATION artifacts, and git history. Physical archival (MILESTONES.md / RETROSPECTIVE.md /
`milestones/`) remains intentionally DEFERRED per the `.planning/` mid-migration caveat.

Guardrails carried forward: explicit-path commits with `git diff --cached --name-only` proof,
`npx tsc --noEmit` before any rebuild, no new WebGL on data surfaces, zinc theme untouched,
`/users/spatial-graph` not touched, honest coverage labels on under-covered sources, never chart
`rowsByModule`, convert `totalBytes` BigInt server-side, never drop the null-`lastSignIn` bucket,
never render a raw issue-type GUID.

Carried-forward open item: owner visual sign-off on the Phase 17 SPLIT-04 split is still
pending (test-basis-only acceptance — no live mount) — see Blockers/Concerns above. Not part
of v2.3 scope.
